        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Pablo Castro and I am a recent graduate with a degree in computer engineering.
            I have always been fascinated by the power of technology and the endless possibilities it offers.
            I have a strong passion for programming and I am constantly seeking new challenges to enhance my skills and
            knowledge.

            During my time in school, I have gained experience in various programming languages such as Python, C++, C#
            and JavaScript.
            I have also worked on a variety of projects, including emulation, web development, and database management.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my technical skills, I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual.
            I have a strong ability to work both independently and in a team environment, and I am always eager to learn
            and grow.

            I am excited to begin my career as a programmer and to contribute my skills to the ever-evolving world of
            technology.
            Whether it's building complex systems or solving challenging problems, I am up for the task and eager to
            make an impact.
        </p>

        <h1 id="experience">Experience</h1>
        <p>
            I worked at DocuSign from June 2022 to October 2022 where I was in a back-end role creating microservices
            that would support our machine learning team. The main techonologies I used during that time would be
            Python, Jenkins, Terraform as well as gaining knowledge of AWS and Microsoft Azure.
        </p>

        <h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
        <p>
            I've worked on a many projects in and out of university here are some that im most proud of!
